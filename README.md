We will import airline arrival data into a Jupyter notebook and use Pandas to clean it. Then, build a machine learning model with Scikit-Learn and use Matplotlib to visualize output.

In this module, we will:

- Import flight data
- Use Pandas to clean and prepare data
- Use Scikit-learn to build a machine-learning model
- Use Matplotlib to visualize the output
